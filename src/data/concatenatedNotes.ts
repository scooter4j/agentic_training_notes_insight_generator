Interesting thing happened on north dam where I was pushing 350-360W, but near the top I had to back off... I backed off to 250W and recovered enough despite that power to dial it back up to 330W with a little bit of the climb remaining. For the north dam climb, from the turn off of Bingham Hill road to the top of north dam it took 12m 1s, with a NP of 260W. The actual climb from the base of the wall to the top took 5m 39s at a NP of 289W, HR avg of 145 and max of 156\n" +

    "I've felt much better today mentally than the last couple of days. I figured out what the trigger for the recent slip and that was mention of a woman from church who had struggled with mental health problems (depression) for a long time. She once was vibrant and fun-loving, but started declining, and according to her husband, fought valiantly against the decline but ultimately lost (suicide, I think). That story scared me b/c of my fear of slipping down the slope of mental illness and failing despite my efforts against that. Just made me wonder if I would slip so far as to do anything harmful to Rachel or myself. Reid and I talked about it a lot and my trajectory is going in the opposite direction, showing increasing release of the anxiety and fear. I've also resumed thinking about me (and Rachel) in a future tense (upcoming vacations, hiking, having years to do stuff, whereas when I was in the depths I couldn't do that. \n" +

    "decent from a fear/intrusive thoughts standpoint; a little sad about Rachel and my discussion last night. Perhaps it would be good to recognize that Rachel seems to like to pile on more and more social stuff when we've already had some, like it reminds her of how she likes it and she wants more (we were tied up with friends/family both Saturday and Sunday, and now wants to plan another social evening this coming Saturday). On the other hand, I'm the opposite: since we gave up our Saturday and Sunday nights last week I don't want to give up this coming weekend.\n" +

    "not sure. Pretty sure I've got this low simmering fear that's governing my inner mind... fear of losing my mind, at the lowest level. Fear that my current state - or that of late last week - will prove to be my high-water mark. I'm finding it hard not to ruminate on it. That said, when I *do* get my mind off of it, I'm totally normal and feel normal. Just sticking in that place... somehow have to accomplish that.  This recent emotional-state decline started when I got the 24-hour flu... not sure how that's causitive unless it took me out of my routine, my workouts, my drumming and provided a scenario for me to focus just on myself and on my health/recovery (from the flu), which were the foundational elements that started the mental-health issues in the first place.\n" +

    "This morning I was putting something in my skate-ski bag, which was on the floor a bit back in my closet. I squatted down and reached forward to the bag - reaching a bit farther than I have been (and maybe bending my back to do so vs. strictly hinging at hips). I felt a little pop in my back and some discomfort, primarily in the muscle along the right side of my spine and in the right QL. I believe the pop occurred above the surgery site, but just above it. It's was pretty sore for a while (diminishing now, though I took Tylenol). My left leg started hurting low on the outer quad, but it's most likely this is due to my ride yesterday which was probably harder than it should have been for not having ridden in a few days. Anyway... started getting anxious about potential damage and setback, so took a clonazepam to try to thwart any descent into full-blown anxiety.\n" +
